## Note
Please note that you will need to add the following components in Alchitry Labs before the program can even be flashed into the Alchitry AU:
- button_conditioner.luc
- counter.luc
- decoder.luc
- edge_detector.luc
- pipeline.luc

## Brief Guide
This guide briefly explains how you may use and interact with the Alchitry AU to conduct both manual and auto testing.
