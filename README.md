This repository contains the code for 16-bit ALU, as well as the tester (including FSM and ROMs) to test the various functionalities of the ALU. 

The 16-bit ALU **inputs**:
- A[15:0]
- B[15:0]
- ALUFN[5:0]

The 16-bit ALU **outputs**:
- ALU[15:0]
- Z
- V
- N

It also contains code for both the **manual tester** and the **auto tester**.

## Note
Please note that you will need to add the following components in Alchitry Labs before the program can even be flashed into the Alchitry AU:
- button_conditioner.luc
- counter.luc
- decoder.luc
- edge_detector.luc
- pipeline.luc

---

## Brief Guide
This guide briefly explains how you may use and interact with the Alchitry AU to conduct both manual and auto testing.
